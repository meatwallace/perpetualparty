## what?

- **it plays a list of videos of dope DJ sets from YouTube in pseudo-random
  order**
- playback order is tracked using a simple blockchain and is deterministically
  calculated from the time the first set was added
- playlist data is assembled from events data via a basic pseudo-events store
  (AKA: `Array`)
- adding/removing/disabling tracks doesn't break or change the chain, there's no
  sequential duplicate playbacks, etc.

## why?
