## what?

- plays a list of videos of dope DJ sets from YouTube in pseudo-random order
- playback order is tracked using a simple block chain
- order is deterministically calculated from the time the first set was added
- adding sets doesn't break the chain, no sequential duplicate playbacks, etc.

## why?
